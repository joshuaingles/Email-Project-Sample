Description: Sample files for a text extraction/generation project I've been working on.

-- Files --
  - main.py
  - csv_parser.py
  - preprocessor.py
  - textGen.py
  - README.text

-- Notes --
- The goal of this project is to extract text containing political rhetoric from emails, train a machine learning model based on that text, and then generate dynamic text that utilizes that rhetoric.
- Additional files such as the those containing email content are not included due to the presence of personal data in the emails. This is intended to only be a sample of work.
